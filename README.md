# 🔢 MNIST Digit Classifier using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It serves as a foundation-level demonstration of how deep learning can be used for image classification.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook.
2. Install the required packages (usually pre-installed in Colab).
3. Run all cells to train and test the CNN model.

## 🎯 Model Summary

- Input: 28x28 grayscale images
- Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected dense layers
- Output: 10-class softmax classifier (digits 0-9)

## 🧪 Accuracy

Achieves **~99% accuracy** on the MNIST test set after several epochs of training.

## 📚 Domain Relevance

This project is directly related to the **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** domain and can be extended further for:
- AI-based visual recognition systems
- Intelligent traffic/image management
- Networked edge AI applications

## 📁 Dataset

- Uses the standard [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) available via Keras datasets.
