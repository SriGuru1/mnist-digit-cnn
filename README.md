# MNIST Digit Classifier using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with over 98% accuracy.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Loads MNIST dataset from TensorFlow
2. Normalizes input images
3. Builds a CNN with 2 Conv layers + Dense layers
4. Trains and evaluates the model

## 📊 Results
- Achieved test accuracy: ~98%
- Model can predict handwritten digit images with high accuracy
