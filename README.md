# MNIST Digit Classifier using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 🔍 Project Objective
Build an image classifier that can recognize digits (0–9) with high accuracy using deep learning.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MNIST Dataset

## 📊 Model Architecture
- Input Layer (28x28 grayscale images)
- 2 Convolutional Layers with MaxPooling
- Dense Layers with Dropout for regularization
- Softmax Output Layer

## 🚀 Accuracy Achieved
Achieved > 98% accuracy on test dataset.

## 📁 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `mnist_cnn.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab

## 📎 Dataset
- MNIST digits dataset, loaded using `keras.datasets.mnist`

## 📌 Applications
This project is relevant to:
- Image Classification
- Edge-AI deployment
- AI/ML-Driven Computer Vision

## 📂 Sample Output
Model correctly classifies images like:
[7] → Predicted: 7
[3] → Predicted: 3
[1] → Predicted: 1

This shows that the CNN correctly classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
